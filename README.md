# Spare-time-projects
Here are some spare-time small projects showcasing my current skills. I will add more as I go!

## Python:
**Console Poker** : A simple console-poker game using Python and utilising the acquired knowledge from school.

**Strong Password Generator** : Console-app using Python, asks user for string input, generates a stronger password using l33tstring and tells the user the strength of the final string.

**Lainalapiot (Lainaamo)** : A *group-project* using Python / Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The project name is arbitrary but this showcases the knowledge in full-stack development using Django.

## JS:
**Todo Webite** : Using HTML / CSS and JavaScript, a simple front-end ToDo list, which saves users tasks to the browser cache.
